          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Silvia Langton. I’m originally from Buenos Aires,
            Argentina. I'm a mother of five wonderful kids. I’m also a linguist,
            coder, dog groomer and pursuing a Bachelor in computer science at
            UVU. I worked previously as a retail manager for 16 years. As a
            manager I acquired fundamental skills that will help me in a future
            career. I consider myself a hard worker, and very detail oriented. I’m
            passionate about learning new things, so any opportunity that comes to
            me I’ll take it. My hobbies include playing musical instruments,
            cooking, and playing soccer along with supporting my kids’s soccer
            activities too. I am excited for this new tech career path in my life and
            the opportunity I have to show my kids that you can achieve your goals
            if you work really hard for it</p>
